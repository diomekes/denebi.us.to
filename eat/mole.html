	<h3>&#183;Mole&#183;</h3>
<p>Chicken<br />
1 tsp of Knorr Suiza or 1 cube of chicken bouillon<br />
Salt<br />
1 jar of mole<br />
1 medium tomato sauce a can<br />
Squares of bitter sweet chocolate (optional)</p>
<p>Start by boiling the chicken in water with the knorr suiza or chicken bouillon, and some salt.  Once the chicken is cooked, take it out, and shred it into small pieces.  In a frying pan, big enough to contain everything, empty 1/2 of the jar of mole and the tomato can.  You can add all kind of things to it to make it thicker (as thick as you want it), like the water from the chicken or some bitter sweet chocolate (which need to be melted in advance in another pan au bain marie).  Let the mix come to a boil and let it simmer for a few minutes before adding the shredded chicken pieces.  Let it simmer a while longer with the chicken before serving it.  </p>
