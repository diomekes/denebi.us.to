<p>olives<br />
water<br />
salt<br />
olive oil<br />
<p>Completely submerge olives in water and amount of salt depending on how much water is needed.  Allow to soak for at least ten days, changing out water and salt once every day or two.  Check for bitterness, if still bitter, allow to soak longer.  Make a brine of 1 cup of salt per 10 cups of water (you can boil the water to mix salt in).  Put olives in jar and pour water on them until covered.  Top off jar with a little olive oil.  Will supposedly keep for a year.</p>
