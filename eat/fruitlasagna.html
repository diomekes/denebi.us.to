	<h3>&#183;Fruit&#160;Lasagna&#183;</h3>
	<p>2 bananas sliced<br />
2 apples (I used Fuji) peeled, cored, and cut in small strips<br />
a few strawberries-I think I used about 10-cut in strips<br />
6 Gluten-free Lasagna pasta<br />
Apricot sauce (recipe follows)<br />
A couple of limes/lemons</p>
	<p>Preheat oven to 350F. <br />
Make Apricot sauce.<br />
Peel, cored, and cut apples. Put the strips of one apple in the dish and cover with 1/2 a lemon. Use the other half to cover the rest of the apple so that it does not turn brown. Place one slice bananas and about 5 cut strawberries on top of the apples and cover with 1/2 lime.  Place 3 lasagna pasta on top. Use a ladle and to pour some apricot sauce on top, enough to cover the pasta. Repeat for the second layer.  Then bake for 20-30 minutes until the pasta looks cooked. </p>
	<p>Apricot sauce:<br />
2 cans of apricot (I used to light kind cause it didnt have added sugar; Ill use actual apricots when Kroger starts selling them)<br />
4 Tbsp of sugar<br />
80ml of water<br />
1 drop of vanilla</p>
	<p>Drain the apricot. Place all the ingredients in a pot on medium heat and let it cook until it boils. Once it boils, blend.</p>
	<p>I made this for the first time last night (I had been thinking about it for a while though, I love fruit and wanted something that I could eat for dinner that wouldnt have too much sugar, so I just made it up!). It was delicious, I loved it! Someone suggested that ricotta cheese might be good with it. Ill try to find a Tofu ricotta recipe to try it the next time I make it. Ill probably try to make the lasagna with berries next time too. </p>
