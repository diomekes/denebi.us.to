		<p>There are farmers in the hospitals tonight.<br />
		We don't like to know what we can't see, but we can never see things right.<br />
		There are ghosts that come out in corn fields after dusk.<br />
		If you can't turn into syrup, then you just turn into dust.<br />
		<br />
		There are invisible costs in ever pack or box you buy,<br />
		with the highest often in those with the lowest dollar signs.<br />
		So can you personally pay to get your shit out of the lake,<br />
		or can spend an extra dollar at the store?<br />
		<br />
		Do you really need that strawberry from the other side of the country,<br />
		or can you eat more of what we can actually afford?<br />
		<br />
		Because if we don't change what we're eating,<br />
		how can we change how we're living?<br />
		And if we don't change how we're living,<br />
		this world will not last for long.<br />
		<br />
		So turn routine into ritual<br />
		and eat.<br />
