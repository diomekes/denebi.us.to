	<h3>&#183;Chocolate&#160;crepes&#183;</h3>
	<p>Today is Valentine&#8217;s day so I decided to make chocolate crepes. I got the inspiration from Iron Chef&#8230;and made up my own recipe.</p>
	<p>150 g of brown rice flour<br />
1 egg<br />
250 ml of rice/soy milk (or any other milk)<br />
35-50 grams of chocolate chips (I used EnjoyLife)<br />
1/2-1 cup of frozen blueberries<br />
1 banana<br />
butter</p>
	<p>Mix the flour, egg and the milk until the flour is completely absorb. Melt the chocolate with a little bit of water in the microwave for 5- 10 secs.  Mix the chocolate with the flour mix. Heat a small pan with a little bit of butter. Place 1 ladle of the flour mix in the pan as you turn in so that the mix covers the entire surface of the pan.  Cook both sides of the crepes until it is lightly brown and no longer wet.  Put aside and repeat with the rest of the mix. You should be able to make about 5 crepes&#8230;you can always double the recipe if you want more. Put the blueberries in the microwave for 45 secs until they are defrosted (it might not take that long for you but my microwave kinda sucks at defrosting stuff). Then, stack two crepes on a plate, place 3 pieces of bananas in the middle (cut them however you want to&#8230;I cut them sideways) then cover the bananas with the blueberries and serve. We ended up cutting the rest of the banana and eating it with the crepes&#8230;it was delicious&#8230;</p>
