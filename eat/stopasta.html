	<h3>&#183;Spinach, tomato, onion&#160;pasta&#183;</h3>
	<p>10 oz of frozen spinach<br />
1 cup of homemade tomato sauce (see recipe)<br />
1/2 of onion soup (Rachael Ray&#8217;s recipe, see below)<br />
Brown rice pasta</p>
	<p>Cook the pasta until done. Boil some water and add the spinach to the boiling water for 1 minutes or until completely defrosted. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it and replace it in the pot (with some olive oil if you like so the pasta does not stick). Add the drained spinach, homemade tomato sauce and the onion soup to the pasta and mix. </p>
	<p>I have not actually made this recipe from scratch. I happened to have all those ingredients as left overs in my fridge and decided to mix them. So, I am not sure on the exact quantity you need. It turned out to be delicious.</p>
	<p>Ill add the onion soup recipe later on</p>
