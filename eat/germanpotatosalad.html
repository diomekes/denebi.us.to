4 slices of bacon<br />
1 tblsp of flour<br />
2 tblsp of white sugar<br />
1/3 cup of water<br />
1/4 cup of cider or white wine vinegar<br />

<p>Place the potatoes in a large pot and cover them with water; add some salt to the water.  Cook the potatoes until they are tender but still firm. Drain them and let them cool off for a bit before chopping them. Place the bacon in a skillet and cook it until it is light brown. Then remove the bacon to the side and cut it in small pieces; save the grease.  Add the water, flour, sugar, and vinegar to the skillet with the grease and cook the mixture until it is thick. Add the potatoes, bacon, and the onions to the mix stirring to cover the potatoes with the mixture. Add some salt and pepper to taste.  </p>
